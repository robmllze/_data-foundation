# About

The [Foundation](https://github.com/robmllze/foundation) template is divided into several modules. This helps separate concerns and makes it easier to manage the codebase.

This is the Foundation's Data Module and it contains the following:

- **Data Model Classes**: maps raw data from the database <---> Dart models.
- **Data Models**: maps raw strings <---> Dart Types (Enums).
- **Data Utils**:

## Notes

Rename `_data-foundation` to `_data` before using it in your project.
