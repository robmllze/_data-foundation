# Data Module

## About

The [Foundation](https://github.com/robmllze/foundation) template is divided into several modules. This helps separate concerns and makes it easier to manage the codebase.

This is the Foundation's Data Module. It plays a crucial role in defining the data within the app.

It comprises of the following:

- **Data Models**: A collection of Data Models (Classes) that represent the data structures within the app.
- **Data Model Extensions**: Extensions to enhance the capabilities of the aforementioned data classes.
- **Data Pool Extensions**: Filtering and sorting extensions for collections of data models.
- **Data Types**: A collection of Data Types (Enums) that classify raw data, helping identify the correct mappers to transform this data into structured models.
- **Data Utils**: A collection of versatile utilities designed for working with Models and Types.

## Notes

- Rename `_data-foundation` to `_data` before using it in your project.
