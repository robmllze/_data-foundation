# Data Module

## About

This is the Foundation's Data Module and it contains the following:

- **Data Models (Classes)**: Maps raw data from the database <---> Generated Dart Models.
- **Data Model Extensions**: Dart extensions to enhance the capabilities of the above mentioned data classes with tailored methods.
- **Data Types (Enums)**: Maps raw strings <---> Generated Dart Types.
- **Data Utils**: A set of general-purpose utilities that are not necessarily tied to a specific Model or Type.

The [Foundation](https://github.com/robmllze/foundation) template is divided into several modules. This helps separate concerns and makes it easier to manage the codebase.

## Notes

- Rename `_data-foundation` to `_data` before using it in your project.
